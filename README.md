#Testing APIs Data Collection

Under `Test Environment` the APIs use the following data collections:

- [List of Origin and Destinations](data/flightsearch.md) for `Flight Inspiration Search` and `Flight Cheapest Date Search`.

- [List of Origin and Destinations](data/ti.md) for `Flight Most [Searched|Booked|Traveled] Destinations` and `Flight Busiest Traveling Period`.

- The [following table](data/checkinlinks.md) contains a list of valid airlines for `Flight Check-in Links`.

- `Airport Nearest Relevant` & `Airport & City Search` contain data from United States, Spain, United Kingdom, Germany and India.

- `Airline Code Lookup` contains almost all airlines.

- The content of `Hotel Search` comes directly from the hotel providers, so the content might change dynamically.
